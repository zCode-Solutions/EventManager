# EventManager

Every small organization needs an event application. This idea is inspired by the previous coding challenge given by the Technologist of Color organization. The goal of the project is to build a web app that allows the creation and maanagement of their own events. Once registered users can log in to see what events have been submitted and either accept or approve them. If an organization is interested in collaborating with the organization they need to submit an online form to provide deatils about the event.
